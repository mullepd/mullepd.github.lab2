*GEOG 458 Lab 2 - collecting and mapping geotagged tweets using Tweepy and GQIS.*

## Overview of the Lab
The purpose of this lab was to gain experience interacting with the Twitter API
as well as mining social media data, then doing some very basic analysis of the
data in the form of word clouds and maps.

To interact with the Twitter API, we used Tweepy in a python script to pull and
store geotagged tweets in realtime. We then took the CSV's and mapped them
using QGIS in order to understand the spatial distribution of tweets in the
continental United States. *Note: I used the continental US because I was not
getting very good data from other geographical areas of interest.* In tandem
with the spatial distribution of tweets, we used Word Art to analyze the most
common words that were tweeted within this geographical region.
